# 🧠 Logic-Based Problem Solving

This repository contains **logic-based and problem-solving programs** implemented in multiple programming languages.  
It is created to strengthen my **programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and interview preparation**.


The same types of problems are solved using:
- **C**
- **C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Choose a programming language folder
2. Pick a problem
3. Understand the logic
4. Run the program in your local environment
5. Try implementing the same logic in other languages

---

## 📈 Progress & Practice

- One problem = one commit
- Problems are added regularly
- Code is written with clarity and simplicity for beginners
